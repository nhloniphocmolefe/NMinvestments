<p>NMIvestments (“NMi”) is the developer and operator of the free service dedicated to enabling former members of South African retirement funds, their beneficiaries, legal and registered financial advisors to search for unclaimed benefits or unpaid surplus that may be owed.</p>

<p>South Africa has approximately R42 billion unclaimed benefits due to over 4 million people.</p>

<p>As Uber© connects drivers with passengers and AirBnB© connects accommodation providers with travellers, so NMi connects owners with the custodians of unclaimed benefits. It does this through a number of channels including the FSB Financial Services Provider online search portal <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/Pages/Default.aspx">Financial Services Board </a>,social media, short code sms, call centre, remote agents, contracted partners and ‘bricks and mortar’ outlets.

<p>NMi contracts with retirement funds, fund and claim administrators who submit on a regular basis the details of former fund members who are due benefits. A list of the retirement funds which currently have unclaimed benefits listed on the NMi service can be viewed by clicking the Fund Listing button above.</p>

NMi does not assist with the actual claim process but rather provides individuals and the entity holding the unclaimed benefit with each other’s contact details. In addition, NMi does not assist with UIF claims nor does it have all unclaimed benefits listed on its database. However you can go on the department of labour website on this <a href="http://www.labour.gov.za/DOL/">link.</a>
</p>

<p>Over 300,000 South Africans have utilised the service to date to search for monies that may be due to them or deceased relatives.</p>
